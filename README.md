The autoreload code seems to be implicated; when run with `--noreload` a
SEGFAULT does not occur. In this specific example `boto3` is also implicated,
even though it's not used (it's only imported). Without importing `boto3` there
is no SEGFAULT.

### Open issues

I think these issues are all the same root cause, which seems to implicate
threading:

- [docker-library/python#211](https://github.com/docker-library/python/issues/211) (the issue I filed)
- [esnme/ultrajson#254](https://github.com/esnme/ultrajson/issues/254)
